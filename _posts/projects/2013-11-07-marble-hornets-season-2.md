intro: "DVD cover design for Marble Hornets, a popular YouTube horror series created by Troy Wagner, Joseph DeLage, and Tim Sutton."

This was a lot of fun to make, especially since I hardly ever get to do any work with real photography. It was great to be able to set up scenes like this, position everything just right, and take some panoramic photos. Of course, Photoshop helped a lot in the end to achieve the creepiness I was looking for.

## Outer cover

The scrawled drawings seen on the outside cover were inspired by those in the actual series. They were done with notebook paper and charcoal—only the best. I actually auctioned these off a couple of years later---seeing an actual demand for them made me feel pretty great.

## Inner cover

The inside cover features a few elements from the series (pill bottle, Slenderman doll, mask, and torn up newspaper) strewn around on top of my desk.

## Challenges

I’d say the hardest part of designing this cover was keeping everything true to the original series---I’m in no way involved with the production of the Marble Hornets entries themselves, so I had to make my own version of the mask, find the exact “slender” doll used in the entries, and look through my medicine cabinet for a bottle of pills that vaguely resembled the ones seen in the series. I’d say it worked out pretty well.
