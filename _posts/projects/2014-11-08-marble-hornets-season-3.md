intro: "When I was approached to design another cover for Marble Hornets, I was extremely excited to see how I could capture the feeling of Season 3."

## Back at it again

Back in 2011 when I first designed the cover for the second season of Marble Hornets, I wasn't really sought out by anyone. I got the job by being a fan, making a DVD cover of my own volition, and sending it to the Marble Hornets guys on a wing and a prayer. At the time, the reaction I got was something like, "Thanks? We didn't really ask for this, but it's nice. Can we buy it from you?".

That said, by the time Season 3 was coming to a close, I didn't have to rely on such tactics---I received a message asking me if I'd be interested in doing another cover for them. I suppose the moral of the story is that if you want a job but have no way of getting it, you should just...do it anyway. I mean, it worked for me!

## Making a difference

The Season 2 cover is really sporadic-looking, with a bunch of scrawled writing on torn, crumpled pages---reminiscent of those from the series itself. This time around, I wanted to prepare for the possibility of a future box set by creating a good amount of contrast between the two covers I designed. While Season 2 is really warm and vibrant, Season 3 is a cool blue with a lot of noise. For the typeface, I chose Camcorder, a VHS-looking font that is used in Totheark's videos in the actual series.

## Inside story

The inner cover features grayscale images of the series' three main characters (I wanted to use the word "protagonists", but it's really not that simple with MH). The high contrast was something that the creators really wanted, and I think it creates a pretty haunting feeling. Jay (middle panel) looked a little bored in the raw image provided to me, so I chose to give him more of a frown and darken his eyes, making him look extremely sleep-deprived. If you've ever seen the series, I'm sure you'll agree it's appropriate.

That's about it for this write-up---if you like this cover, be sure to check out the cover for Season 2, as well as the Box Set!
