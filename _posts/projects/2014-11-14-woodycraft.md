intro: "For this project, I teamed up with Craftilldawn to create a large site for a popular Minecraft server."

I came up with a preliminary mockup to start with. Then <a href="http://craftilldawn.com">Craftilldawn</a> worked on the graphics, lining them up with the aesthetic style I created. This was my first experience with Xenforo, and I ended up learning a lot.
